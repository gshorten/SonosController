    - "sections":                 List of page sections, ie groups of individual wallbox selections;
        Each item in the list of page sections is a dictionary, there can be as many sections as desired,
        Each section must follow sequentially from the one before (see "start", "end" below
        Three different kinds of dictionary:
        - sonos favorites:        range of sonos favorites to map onto wallbox selections
            "name":               Display friendly name of section
            "type":               must be "sonos_favorites"
            "start_favorites":    first sonos favorite in the section, 0 indexed
            "end_favorites":      last sonos favorite in the section
            "start":              first wallbox page selection, 0 indexed, must follow from previous section
            "end":                last wallbox page selection, 0 indexed, maximum 200
        - sonos playlists:        range of sonos playlist selections to map on to wallbox selections

        -playlist_selections:     individual songs from a sonos playlist
        The wallbox page sections must be sequential, and the start and end for each section cannot overlap.
        There can be as many sections as desired, mixed types ok.
        The start and end of each section must all add up to the number of wallbox selections - 1 to 200
